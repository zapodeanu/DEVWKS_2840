Configuration Monitoring and Compliance using Cisco DNA Center

This repo will showcase an use case of how to detect and mitigate unauthorized, or non-compliant configuration changes. 

**The Challenge:**
 - 70% of policy violations are due to user errors
 - Configuration drifting 

**The Goal:**
 - Detect and alert on all network configuration changes
 - Automated roll back of non-compliant changes
 - Approval process for all compliant configuration changes

**The Solution:**
 - Integration between Cisco DNA Center, ServiceNow, IOS XE Programmability, and Webex Teams
 - The application may run on demand, scheduled or continuously

**Workflow:**
 - Collect real time network devices running configurations using the Cisco DNA Center Command Runner APIs
 - Create a local folder with all the running configurations
 - If the device is new, add the configuration to the local folder
 - If device is known, check for configuration changes
 - If a change occurred, identify who made the change, the device name, physical location and device health
 - Record changes by creating a ServiceNow incident
 - Identify what changed and the relevant section of the configuration
 - Inspect against provided compliance policies:
   - no logging configuration changes, 
   - no access control lists configuration,
   - prevent IPv4 duplicate addresses
 - Rollback configuration if compliance violations, test if successful or not, update the ServiceNow incident
 - If no compliance violations ask for approval from change control manager and update ServiceNow incident
 - Act upon the answer in ServiceNow - approved/denied or timeout by saving the new configuration or rollback the configuration
 - Update the ServiceNow incident with the approval process
 - The “configuration save to file”, “save to startup configuration”, and “configuration rollback” tasks are completed using NETCONF and RESTCONF
 - Notify IT organizations of new, updated and closed ServiceNow incidents using the ServiceNow to Webex Teams integration

**The Results:**
 - Non compliant configuration changes are mitigated in minutes
 - Troubleshooting assistance by providing a real time view of all device configuration changes

**Setup and Configuration:**
 - The requirements.txt file include all the Python libraries needed for this application
 - This application requires:
   - Cisco DNA Center
   - IOS XE devices configured for NETCONF and RESTCONF
   - Cisco Webex Teams account
   - ServiceNow developer account
 - The config.py is the only file needed to be customized to match your environment

**Cisco Products & Services:**

- Cisco DNA Center
- IOS XE Network Devices
- Webex Teams

**Other Platforms:**

- ServiceNow

**Roadmap:**
 - Build a web based dashboard
 - Create additional compliance checks
 - Create northbound APIs to provide additional services like - device configuration file retrieval, configurations search, archiving, reporting
